1) Introduction
=================================================
The ImageCaptionTools project is a suite of tools useful when
working with image caption data. While this project is far from
stand-alone, the intent of separating the functionality represented
here from the ImageCaptionLearn project was to enable other
students working with the same data to easily access these utilities.

ImageCaptionTools encapsulates both the necessary components for
working with image caption data and miscellaneous Java utilities.

=================================================
2) Build
=================================================
Assuming one has set up their java / maven / etc paths correctly,
The ImageCaptionTools can be built and installed using the accompanying
build.sh script, which is little more than a wrapper for the maven
package, install, and deploy commands.
When building, we assume a directory structure as
ImageCaptionTools
|---target
|---src
    |---main
        |---java
            |---core
            |---nlptools
            |---structures
            |---utilities
From there, maven (by way of the accompanying pom.xml) should
compile the src into the target dir, which will contain a
    ImageCaptionTools-VERSION.jar
In order to include ImageCaptionTools into other projects
(e.g. ImageCaptionLearn) as a Maven dependency, include the following
    <dependency>
        <groupId>edu.illinois.cs.cl</groupId>
        <artifactId>ImageCaptionTools</artifactId>
        <version>1.0.0</version>
    </dependency>


=================================================
3) Modules
=================================================
ImageCaptionTools are organized into several modules,
which tie together broad thematic elements. These include

    a) core
       Containing only the DocumentLoader, the core is
       essentially the main file for ImageCaptionTools.
       The DocumentLoader reads image caption data from
       a database and packages that data into the
       structures found in the structures package
    b) nlptools
       Housing utilities for external NLP resources,
       nlptools contains wrappers for Stanford's Annotator,
       Word2Vec, Wordnet, and the Illinois CogComp Annotator
    c) structures
       The structures module contains the objects necessary to
       represent the highly structured nature of image caption data.
       Documents are associated with sets of captions and an image,
       captions can be represented as sequences of chunks, mentions,
       and tokens, and coreferent mentions are clustered into chains,
       which can be associated with bounding boxes.
    d) utilities
       The utilities module contains all the miscellaneous
       utilities, including but not limited to functions for
       interacting with databases (DBConnector), writing
       files (FileIO), manipulating strings (StringUtil), and
       computing statistics (StatisticalUtil)
