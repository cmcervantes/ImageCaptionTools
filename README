Assuming one has set up their java / maven / etc paths correctly,
The ImageCaptionTools can be built and installed using the accompanying
build.sh script, which is little more than a wrapper for the maven
package, install, and deploy commands.
When building, we assume a directory structure as
ImageCaptionTools
|---target
|---src
    |---main
        |---java
            |---core
            |---nlptools
            |---structures
            |---utilities
From there, maven (by way of the accompanying pom.xml) should
compile the src into the target dir, which will contain a
    ImageCaptionTools-VERSION.jar
However, the point of breaking the ImageCaptionTools into their
own project is to enable their inclusion as a maven dependency.
To do so, include the following
    <dependency>
        <groupId>edu.illinois.cs.cl</groupId>
        <artifactId>ImageCaptionTools</artifactId>
        <version>1.0.0</version>
    </dependency>
